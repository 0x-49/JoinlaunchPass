Why Deal in NFT & Crypto?
LaunchPass has been powering Discord, Telegram and Slack communities that have a pulse on what’s trending for over 5 years, from stock news and trading to cook groups and beyond. Many of our fastest growing communities are involved with cryptocurrency and NFT, and thousands of subscribers use them to find the latest information.

For those not in the know, Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that can be used to buy goods and services or be traded for profit. It’s experienced a huge boom in trading which has driven up its worth, led by popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) are a relatively new and very popular crypto phenomenon that convert things like digital art into one-of-a-kind, verifiable digital assets that hold value as a form of cryptocurrency, and are easy to trade on the blockchain.

Both NFT & Crypto are extremely popular right now, and we see this in play on LaunchPass, with thriving, fast-growing communities on these topics boasting thousands and thousands of paying subscribers.

I love LaunchPass!!
LaunchPass manages everything perfectly and flawlessly. If you run any type of business with recurring subs and have dealt with the frustration of removing and adding members yourself, you need LaunchPass ASAP. My business grew exponentially after teaming up with them, absolutely love LaunchPass and their team!

Wow! CEO reached out to me!! Wow!!
Wow!! What a seriously amazing experience I had with LaunchPass. I had an issue, and the CEO reached out to me personally and offered to help me solve it immediately! Never expected a CEO to reach out to personally help me! I’m extremely happy with their service team, the CEO Seth, and Arygrios the Customer Service Manager!

It seems like any new tech company doesn't even have an 800 number. LaunchPass is the total opposite. I got a personal rep (Danny) to assist me and he was well-versed, knowledgeable, and had answers for the very many questions I asked. I wish every company had a Danny and offered a similar experience! 5/5 stars!

I wanted to take some time to give a shout-out to LaunchPass. Without them I wouldn’t be able to launch a successful discord server. From start to finish they made this process very easy. They helped me every step of the way. The customer service is amazing! I’m excited to see what the future holds.

LaunchPass is just Awesome!
LaunchPass has always given me great service with no long waiting times, canned responses, lack of product knowledge, etc. They care about their customers and this alone will place them lightyears ahead of their competition (if any!). They get 5 stars from me!

Starting out my business with LaunchPass has allowed me to expand my company from setting my server up, to managing payments and overall user experience. I've been able to focus on the growth of my business while letting LaunchPass handle the backend of my system! It is by far one of the best solutions out there for any business looking to monetize their Discord group. You guys are awesome! Thank you so much for everything!!

Using LaunchPass has helped our business immensely. Not only did it automate the signup process, but it also helps us keep track of every member, whether they have paid, are currently active, or when they canceled. Moving to LaunchPass was the best decision we ever made.

Were it not for LaunchPass the logistics of establishing a subscription service on Discord would be near impossible! Customers can seamlessly join and leave using the platform, and the integration of Stripe makes all the numbers digestible. The customer service LaunchPass provides is second to none.
